# TrainSafeVR

## Overview
TrainSafeVR is a Virtual Reality (VR) training simulation designed for the Oak Ridge Enhanced Technology and Training Center (ORETTC). This project provides an immersive and realistic training environment for leak detection and response scenarios, adhering to Department of Energy (DOE) Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). By utilizing VR, TrainSafeVR aims to enhance safety, efficiency, and preparedness in hazardous environments.

## Features
- **Realistic Environment**: Modeled after ORETTC using real-world measurements and references, including Google Street View screenshots for accuracy.
- **Leak Detection and Response**: Implements DOE SOPs for realistic and effective training.
- **VR Locomotion and Interactions**:
  - Free locomotion
  - Height adjustment
  - Snap turning
  - Teleporting (in progress)
- **NPC Voice Interactions**: Powered by CONVAI, enabling natural and dynamic communication with virtual characters.
- **Replay System**: After Action Review for trainees to analyze their performance.
- **Scenario Customization**: Flexible setup for creating new training scenarios.

## Technologies Used
- **Unreal Engine**: Core development platform.
- **VR Hardware**: Designed for compatibility with popular VR devices.
- **CONVAI**: AI-powered NPC voice interactions.
- **GitHub**: Version control and collaboration.
- **DOE SOP Guidelines**: Reference document for simulation scenarios.
